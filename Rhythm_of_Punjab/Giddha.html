        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Giddha is a traditional Punjabi folk dance performed exclusively by women. It serves as the female counterpart to Bhangra and is characterized by graceful movements, rhythmic clapping, and the singing of boliyanâ€”short folk verses that often express emotions, stories, or social commentary.</p><br>

        <h2>Music:</h2>
        <p>The primary accompaniment is the rhythmic clapping of the dancers themselves, complemented by the dholak (a smaller drum) and the singing of boliyan, which provide both rhythm and narrative to the performance.</p><br>

        <h2>Costume:</h2>
        <p>Performers adorn themselves in traditional Punjabi attire, typically consisting of a vibrant salwar kameez (a tunic paired with loose-fitting trousers) and a phulkari dupatta (embroidered scarf). They often accessorize with traditional jewelry, enhancing the elegance and cultural authenticity of the dance.</p>
